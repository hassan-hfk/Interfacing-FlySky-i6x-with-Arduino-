# FlySky i6X Digital Control via Trainer Port

This project demonstrates how to digitally control the FlySky FS-i6X RC transmitter using an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. By leveraging the transmitterâ€™s Trainer Port, Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) signals can be injected to simulate joystick input programmatically. This allows for seamless control over all six channels (Roll, Pitch, Throttle, Yaw, and two auxiliary channels), opening up possibilities for advanced drone experiments, autonomous testing, and integration with computer vision or AI models.

## Key Features

- Digital control of FlySky i6X without modifying internal hardware  
- PPM signal generation using Arduino or Raspberry Pi  
- Support for all primary and auxiliary channels  
- Custom flight mode control via auxiliary channels  
- Non-invasive method using standard Trainer Port input  
- Code examples for both Arduino and Python (Raspberry Pi)

## Applications

- Autonomous or AI-based drone navigation and testing  
- Keyboard or GUI-based manual drone control  
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation and prototyping  
- Interfacing with computer vision pipelines (e.g., object tracking, gesture control)  
- Safer and more repeatable test flights in controlled environments
